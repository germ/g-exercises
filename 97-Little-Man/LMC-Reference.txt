This is the reference for the LMC

// Instructions
ADD 	Add memory at address to the acc
SUB 	Subtract memory at address to acc
STA 	Store accumulator at address
LDA 	Load from address into acc
BRA 	Set the PC to address 
BRZ 	If acc is zero or neg flag set, set PC to address
BRP 	If acc is greater the zero, set PC to address
INP 	Move from Inbox to acc
OUT 	Move from acc to Outbox
000 	End Program
DAT 	Store operand in this address

// Labels
Labels are supported by this assembler. To use labels place 
the labelname before instruction. The following is a labeled
address that contains the data 10 "counter DAT 10"

// Comments
Comments are started with a semicolon on column 1

// Input/Output
The simulator will try reading from STDIN for Input. Failing this 
the user will be prompted to type a character. Output is buffered
and displayed in it's entirety on halt.

// Stopping execution
Sending sigkill will halt execution and dump buffered output to STDIN
